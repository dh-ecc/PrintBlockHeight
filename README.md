# Print Block Height

A barebones demonstration of consuming `ZCashLightClientKit` as an SPM dependency. It will print the block height of testnet. (As a bonus this now demonstrates macOS integration as well)


```sh
git clone https://github.com/dh-ecc/PrintBlockHeight
cd PrintBlockHeight
swift run
```
